and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Escape key cancels an in-progress dictation without transcribing or pasting
- Initial Speech-to-Text (STT) engine using whisper-rs with CoreML/Metal acceleration
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) placeholder using kokoroxide (Kokoro-82M)
- Global hotkey support for dictation (⌘+⇧+D) and screen reading (⌘+⇧+S)
- Model manager UI for downloading and switching STT/TTS models
- Real-time waveform visualization during recording
- Voice preview for TTS voice selection
- Settings panel for configuring hotkeys and preferences
- System tray integration with quick access menu
- Floating overlay for dictation status
- React frontend with Tailwind CSS styling
- Tauri v2 backend with Rust
- macOS Sonoma (14.0+) support optimized for Apple Silicon
- Live permission status indicators for Microphone and Accessibility
- Redesigned dictation overlay (400x200) with real audio waveform, timer, and full transcript
- Streaming partial transcripts during transcription via whisper-rs segment callbacks
- `usePermissions` React hook for polling macOS permission status
- `check_permissions` Tauri command using AXIsProcessTrusted FFI and cpal device detection

### Changed
- Dictation overlay enlarged from 320x80 to 400x200 with three-section layout
- Transcription uses `transcribe_streaming` with segment callbacks instead of batch-only processing
- Onboarding permission cards show live granted/not-granted status and hide button when granted
- Settings panel permission rows show green "Granted" or red "Not Granted" badges
- Dictation hotkey is now hybrid: tap to start / tap again to stop, or hold push-to-talk style and release to stop
- Right Option key alone is the default dictation trigger (Fluid Voice style), via a native listen-only CGEventTap; configurable back to any accelerator in Settings. Option+letter combos are suppressed (they cancel/ignore the gesture instead of dictating)
- Silence auto-stop now applies to hotkey dictation (was panel-only) so tap-started dictation finishes hands-free
- Whisper model is cached between dictations and preloaded at launch instead of reloading from disk every time
- Closing the main window hides it (tray "Show Blah³" keeps working); quit from the tray menu

### Deprecated
- N/A

### Removed
- N/A

### Fixed
- Dictation overlay window was denied all IPC (missing from capabilities), so it never received recording/transcribing/result events
- Auto-paste no longer permanently clobbers the clipboard: previous text contents are restored after the paste
- Auto-paste failures now show an error toast (text stays in clipboard for manual Cmd+V) instead of failing silently
- A quick tap of the dictation hotkey no longer errors with "No audio captured"
- App test suite repaired (async onboarding gate was unmocked) and tsc --noEmit errors removed

### Security
- N/A
